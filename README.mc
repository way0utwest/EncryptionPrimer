# Encryption Primer Demo Code

This repo includes the code used for The Encryption Primer presentation from Steve Jones. There have been a number of instances of this presentation, across different versions of this talk. This code should work on SQL Server 2016 or higher, but it has lastly been updated for SQL Server 2022.

## SQL Server Setup

These scripts were updated and tested on SQL Server 2022. An instance is required, and the setup will create a database for the demos.

## Outside SQL Setup

Create c:\encryptionprimer as a folder, or change the path in scripts.

Download [XVI32](http://www.chmaas.handshake.de/delphi/freeware/xvi32/xvi32.htm) or another hex editor for the TDE demo.

IF you want to experiment with certificates, copy makecert.exe to this folder or change the path in scripts.
